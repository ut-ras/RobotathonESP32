# Robotathon Docs

Hello! This guide is separated into multiple sections each with graphics, tips, and sample code or examples. 

We suggest that you read the pages as you progress with your robot - please reference back to this guide when you need direction. Also understand that this guide, while broad, is not comprehensive. We want you to discover solutions by yourselves, so we will only provide the bare minimum to create a working robot.

Finally, if you have any technical questions or don’t understand a topic, ask the mentors or during office hours! We can help to resolve your problems, or point you to the right person who can. The mentors, office hours, tech talks, our youtube video series, and other teammates are valuable resources to turn to.

## Overview

The first section, Getting Started, sets you up for success in regards to getting familiar with the ESP32 microcontroller, the software build process, and embedded systems development in general. We highly recommend that you at least take a look at Environment Setup, as this page will streamline your development process and prevent a lot of environment errors you may get in the future.

The second section, Sensors and Actuators, involves building the circuits and programming the software that controls your robot. To soften the learning curve, we abstract a lot of logic needed to program the ESP32, and provide high level interfaces for you to use described in our [wiki](https://github.com/ut-ras/Rasware/wiki). We encourage you to utilize our APIs beyond what is used in each instructional page.

The third section, Designing a Robot, is pretty self explanatory. We’ll cover the computer aided design (CAD) software - SOLIDWORKS - that Mechanical Engineers will use in their courses here. We’ll also discuss the physical construction of a robot, as well as the resources the engineering Makerspace provides to students.


The fourth section, Debugging, provides optional, but highly recommended guides to problem solving. Trust us, >95% of your code problems can be solved with the right Google search, saving you time and stress.

Finally, the Robotathon steering committee appreciates your feedback! If you have questions that you think should be clarified here, or topics that you think should be covered in the next revision of this guide, please fill out our [google form!](https://forms.gle/6UpwaETAtQpkvoMa8)
