# Mechanical Challenge Checkpoint

***replace with picture of current mech challenge***

To pass this checkpoint, your robot should meet the following requirement:

* Launch a ping pong ball some distance (at least 2 feet)

**OR**

* Push the ball manually or autonomously (this will earn minimal points during the mech challenge)

Some questions we might ask about this checkpoint are:

* Why did you design the mechanism the way you did?
* Are there any improvements to be made with your solution to the mechanical challenge?
