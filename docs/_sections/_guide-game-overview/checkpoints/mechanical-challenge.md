# Mechanical Challenge Checkpoint

***replace with picture of current mech challenge***

To pass this checkpoint, your robot should meet the following requirement:

* Autonomously launch a ping pong ball some distance

OR
* Push the ball manually or autonomously (this will earn minimal points during the mech challenge)

Some questions we might ask about this checkpoint are:

* How did you tell your robot to start the mechanical challenge?
* Is this your intial design for the launch mechanism?
* Why did you design the mechanism the way you did?
