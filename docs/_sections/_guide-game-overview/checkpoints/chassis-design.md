# Chassis Design Checkpoint
To pass this checkpoint, your design should meet the following requirements:
* A drawn schematic of your chassis and where you plan to place each component (does not have to be detailed)

Components to include:
* 1 ESP32 on breadboard
* 1 USBC breakout PD circuit
* 1 Portable Battery mount
* 1 Dual Motor Driver
* 2 DC Motors
* 1 Servo
* 1 Caster Wheel
* 1 Line Sensor
* 1 Color Sensor
* __>__ 2 IR Distance Sensors
* 1 White LED near the color sensor ([why?](https://ut-ras.github.io/RobotathonESP32/sensors-and-actuators/color-sensors))

Questions:
* What materials are you going to use to build your robot chassis? (recommend TIW laser cut for main body and 3D print for other parts)
* Is your design easily repairable in case something breaks?
    * How accessible is your breadboard?
* Is your design within the required dimensions of the rules?
* Does your design account for the mechanical challenge?
