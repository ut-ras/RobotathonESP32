If you choose to, you may purchase other parts using your own money (up to $25), but we stress that this is not necessary, and your kit should have all the materials needed to adequately complete the challenges. If you do decide to purchase parts, please let the organizers know so we can determine whether said part is acceptable for the competition.

# Scoring

This section will detail how points will be tallied up during each round.

### Checkpoints
While placement on competition day will mainly depend on the points earned during competition rounds, the amount of checkpoints that teams successfully completed (and whether they were completed on time or late) will be critical in cases where two teams are tied for points.

Take a look at the [checkpoints section](https://ut-ras.github.io/RobotathonESP32/checkpoints) for specific requirements of each checkpoint!


### Section 1: Breaking into the lab
* +2 points for autonomous completion
* 0 points for manually driving to the correct color tile  

### Section 2: Navigate the lab
* +5 points for autonomous completion
* 0 points for manually driving through the lab   

### Section 3: Dodge the Lasers  
* +5 points for autonomous completion
* 0 points for manually driving along the line  

### Section 4: Destroying the Aggienator!
The Aggienator has three tiers to launch/push your ping pong ball into:
* +3 points for pushing ping pong ball into the first tier
    * Ground level, no launching required
* +5 points for launching ping pong ball into the second tier
    * Elevated above the first tier
* +10 points for launching ping pong ball into the third tier
    * Elevated above second tier


Final winner will be chosen by averaging individual team scores across the 6 rounds and choosing the top 3.
