# Checkpoints
While placement on competition day will mainly depend on the points earned during competition rounds, the amount of checkpoints that teams successfully completed (and whether they were completed on time or late) will be the tiebreaker in cases where two teams are tied for points.

These checkpoints aim to keep you on track to be ready for competition day!
