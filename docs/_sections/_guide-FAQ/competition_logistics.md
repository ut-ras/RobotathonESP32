# Competition Logistics FAQ

## Where/when can I work on my robot?
Teams can work on their robot any time, but the robot and parts bag must be stored in the RAS office. So as long as a RAS leader (like your team mentor) is available to unlock the office, you can work on your robot.

## What does attending a workshop do for my team?
Workshops are hosted by RAS leaders who have knowledge in the topic for that week such as environment setup or sensors and actuators. Having at least one member of your team attend each workshop and take notes will ensure your robot and coding environment are set up correctly, and prevent any microcontroller explosions.

## What will competition day look like?
The night before competition day we will host an all-nighter in the EER to work on your robot and test on the competition field. Before the competition we will introduce each team, and competition usually starts around noon where and teams are put in a 1-on-1 bracket style tournament. After one team wins around 4pm, there will be an award ceremony for first, second, and third place, as well as judges choice, best design, etc. 

## What kind of additional materials can we buy?
Puchasing other materials is not necessary and the components in the bag will be adequate to complete all the challenges. If you choose to purchase extra metarials though, teams can buy anything that will help them with their robot like springs, rods, and electrical components as long as the total cost is less than $25. Wood, filament, or acrylic from the TIW are not included in the $25.
These TIW materials will (most likely) include your chassis and your mechanical chalenge design, as your component bag will not come with either.

## Where can we store our robot in the RAS office?
