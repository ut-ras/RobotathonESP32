## Welcome!

This guide aims to provide you with helpful information and direction throughout your robot building process. While this guide is broad, it stays mostly within the realm of setup and basic tips since we encourage you to discover your own solutions.

If you have any technical questions or donâ€™t understand a topic, ask the mentors in the Discord Robotathon chat or during [Office Hours!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/132Lb-cNybgYhRVPhrrf0xoe3HGi9ErQ2J2lOkMYBeXc/edit?gid=0#gid=0) We can help to resolve your problems, or point you to the right person who can.

## Overview

The first section of the techincal guides, Getting Started, is about getting familiar with the ESP32 microcontroller, the software build process, and embedded systems development in general. We highly recommend that you at least take a look at Environment Setup, as this page will streamline your development process and prevent a lot of environment errors you may get in the future.

The second section, Sensors and Actuators, goes into detail about the various peripherals you will be using in the competition, which include motors, distance sensors, line sensors, and color sensors. Note that all this information is adapted from sources found off the Internet, so Google is a very good resource for more or different documentation.

The third section, Designing a Robot, covers the physical construction of a robot, as well as the resources Texas Inventionworks (TIW) provides to students.

Finally, the Robotathon steering committee appreciates your feedback! If you have questions that you think should be clarified here, or topics that you think should be covered in the next revision of this guide, please fill out our [feedback form!](https://forms.gle/hS7MTfwRQMTDNHXC7)


Note from Jeffrey:
Remember that the whole point of Robotathon is to meet new friends, dip your toes in RAS, and have fun! If you ever have any questions or concerns about anything at all, you can reach me on Discord (@ohoftoryoy) or in person. You can also reach out to any RAS leader, we all want to help you! If you ever feel like you're overwhelmed, falling behind, or anything of the sort, we'll work with you to make sure you and your team can succeed.

Have fun!
