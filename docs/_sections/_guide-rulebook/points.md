# Points

Checkpoints
While placement on competition day will mainly depend on the points earned during competition rounds, the amount of checkpoints that teams successfully completed (and whether they were completed on time or late) will be critical in cases where two teams are tied for points.

Section 1: Breaking in to the Lab
+2 Points for autonomous completion
The robot must identify the color of the first tile in the sequence, then drive in a straight line until the same color tile is found
0 points awarded for manually driving to the correct color tile.

Section 2: Navigating the Lab
+5 Points for autonomous completion



Section 3: Cooking



Challenge: Orderâ€™s Ready!
Maximum of 180 points from ball bonuses (Max 10 PING PONG BALLS PER ROUND)
2 points per ping pong ball picked up in the collection area (rc or automated). Balls can be placed on the robot here
+1 bonus if automated w/ color sensor
2 points per ping pong ball carried across the line (rc or automated).
+1 bonus if automated w/ line sensor
2 points per ping pong ball carried through the maze (rc or automated) 
+1 bonus if automated w/ wall sensor.
2 points per ping pong ball dropped off in the dropoff area.
Each team can deliver their ping pong balls across the field in different pick up locations for the other team to grab. If the other team picks it up and successfully drops it off, then both teams will receive double the amount of points for whatever challenges were completed by the other team when they had the ping pong ball.
Ex. If team A drops off their ping pong ball after the line sensor area and before the maze, and team B picks it up and drops it off at the dropoff area on their side, then both teams will receive 2*3 + 2*3pts (wall) + 2*3pts (dropoff) = 18pts.
MAX NUMBER OF POINTS IN A ROUND (INCLUDES COOPERATION) IS:
2*(10*3 + 10*3 + 10*3 + 10*2) +12 +12 +6= 250

Final winner will be chosen by averaging individual team scores across the 6 rounds and choosing the top 3.
