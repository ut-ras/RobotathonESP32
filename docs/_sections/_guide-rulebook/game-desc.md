# Game Description

Welcome to RASpionage: our spy themed robotics competition! Cooperate with Perry the Platypus to take down Dr. Jeffrey Doofenshmirtz’s nefarious collusion with A&M!

## Rounds
Each team will play in 5 minute long rounds with 2 minute setup times in between. Round number is subject to change as competition day rolls closer. Each team will complete various challenges to score points against another team (bracket TBA).

## Challenges
The main challenge of this game requires each team to break into Dr. Jeffrey Doofenshmirtz’s evil lab, navigate the dangerous traps and obstacles, and finally help Perry destroy the Aggienator!

The color sensor, line sensor, and wall sensor challenges can all be done individually by either side to gain points, but the bulk of the points will be earned by completing the mechanical challenge.


## Remote Controller
The remote controller can be used to drive your robot in the areas between each challenge and trigger autonomous modes tailored to each sensor.
You can use your remote controller to drive through the sensor challenges, but you will NOT EARN POINTS
You are encouraged to use your remote controller in the event that your robot gets stranded in the middle of the field.

## Field
The field is split into two sections, with a layout of the main challenge set up as a mirror image of one another. It is made to accommodate two teams for each round.

Teams will start on opposing corners of the field.

The field configuration is shown below (General location of challenge is correct. Do not refer to for actual format of line or maze)

## Section 1: Breaking into the lab

The robot is tasked with sampling a color, at a far end of the field. 

### Color Challenge
Four colored strips will be placed on the floor. The robot must sample the first strip and remember its color.
Then, test the next three strips to find one that matches the first strip and pick the ping pong ball up.

## Section 2: Navigate the lab (Wall Follow)/Dodge the lasers(or some other line follow doof-esque obstacle)

### Wall Challenge
Requires manual or automated completion of collection.
Your robot must navigate through the maze while carrying a ping pong ball and avoid running into the walls.
If your robot gets stuck you may manually reset your robot to the beginning of the maze section.
One side of the field could have a maze with more turns than the other. In the player’s choice rounds, it’s best if the team with the better wall sensor opts to that side.

### Line Challenge
Requires manual or automated completion of collection but not preparation.
Your robot must follow the path and make it to the end of the line while carrying a ping pong ball
If your robot gets stuck or lost, you may reset your robot, but you must start from the beginning of the path.

{: .highlight}
One side of the field will be more jagged, while the other is curved. The team that met the most checkpoints/deadlines will have the option of choosing which side they want to run.

### Mechanical Challenge: Defeat the Aggienator!
Launch your ping pong ball into one of the tiers of the Aggienator to score points
Tiers will be smaller the higher they are, but scoring in higher tiers will earn more points.
The bottom tier will be at field level, and teams can place ping pong balls in this bottom tier for minimal points.
