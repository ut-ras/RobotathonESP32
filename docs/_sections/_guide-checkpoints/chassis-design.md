To pass this checkpoint, your design should meet the following requirements:
* A drawn picture (does not have to be detailed) that shows where you plan to place each component

Component list: TODO update
* 1 Battery pack

* 2 DC Motors
* 1 Servo
* 1 Caster Wheel
* 1 Line Sensor
* 1 Color Sensor
* 1 IR Distance Sensor
* 1 White LED (color sensor) TODO elaborate or link smth here

Questions:
* What materials are you going to use to build your robot chassis? (recommend TIW laser cut for main body and 3D print for other parts)
* Is your design within the required dimensions?
* Does your design account for the mechanical challenge?
