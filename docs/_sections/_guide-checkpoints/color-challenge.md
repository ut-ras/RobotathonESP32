To pass this checkpoint, your robot should meet the following requirements:

* Have the color sensor attached to the robot in some way
* Be able to sample and store the color of the initial tile
* Autonomously drive until the matching tile color is found

Some questions we might ask about this checkpoint are:

* How did you tell your robot to start the color sensor challenge?
* How did you use the data from the color sensor in your program?
* Why did you place the color sensor in the spot that it is?
