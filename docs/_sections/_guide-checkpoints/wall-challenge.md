To pass this checkpoint, your robot should meet the following requirements:

* Have at least two wall sensors attached to the robot in some way
* Autonomously navigate through a maze until the exit is found

Some questions we might ask about this checkpoint are:

* How did you tell your robot to start the wall sensor challenge?
* How did you use the data from the wall sensors in your program?
* Why did you place the wall sensors in the spots that they are?
