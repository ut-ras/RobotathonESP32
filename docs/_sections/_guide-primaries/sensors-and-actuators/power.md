TODO write this


- How do basic circuits work? (i.e. current only flows in a closed loop, what is voltage, what is ground, etc.)
- What is a breadboard?
  - Power rails (very important), connections
  - include picture of breadboard with highlighted connections
- Note that many pictures in the Robotathon guide depict sensors directly attache to the ESP32 power pin rather than to a power rail. Would be good to mention
- Power ORring with diode how
  - Is the single diode blocking DC input through the ESP32 good enough for power ORring? wouldnt that just damage the USB device
 
- Include diagram of USBC breakout board
