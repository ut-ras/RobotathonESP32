# Mechanical Checkpoint
Your team has to come up with a mechanical design that translates individual robot components into how you envision your robot completing particular tasks. 
A lil intro to engineering projects! Along with your team, these are the bare bones of what it takes to create a project (ahem ahem like a robot?? ahem ahem) from start to finish. For more elaboration on these key steps, I recommend checking out our tutorial on the Engineering Design Process here. 

1- Identify the tasks/functions needed for the challenge
It would be wise to take a look at the RAScade competition rules, my dear. In particular, start thinking about your team’s game plan for each match.
2- Identify how parts can be used
Take a look at the provided parts list. Look up things like what a servo motor is used for or how to operate different sensors! 
3- Brainstorm how you can combine parts to achieve that goal; no wrong ideas!
4- Build/Test/Improve a Prototype

Your robot is faced with the challenge of throwing an object. Here are some “template” designs that might be appealing to look more into! Here’s a separate link that might help with your research. 

A Few Robot Arm Designs

Basic Claw Bot
It gets the job done.

- Up up down down left right left right- I mean use motors to move wheels, lift your bot’s arm(s), and grip or release something.
- Usually done for controlled robots rather than autonomous. 

Conveyor Belt Lift/Drop
Going up? Or down?

- Using flaps, chains, gears, etc, guide stuff from point A to B.
- Can be used to transfer something front to back or vice versa as well. 
-Make sure the objects are supported by the system!

Flywheel Shooter
There is a need for speed in order to fly.

-With a wheel (or two!) and a fast enough motor and friction, your bot can send stuff flying!
-Whatever is holding the wheel and axle that spins needs to be held steady! Don’t need your whole bot shaking now do we?

Fling/Catapult
An oldie but a goodie.

-A strong enough flick of the wrist can project an object away from the bot. 
- Rubber bands could be used like a slingshot. 
-Be careful to balance the weights of the bot and what the lever arm is flinging!

Pusher/Intake
To hold objects or let them go.

- Get creative for how your bot wrangles objects closer to or away from itself near to the ground. 
- Can be passive or active with motors. 
- Avoid scenarios where objects could get stuck! 

The engineering design process is just that- a process! Designs don’t always work they way you planned, so be prepared to do a lot (and I mean a lot) of revising to end up achieving the goal you originally intended. Keep an open mind and think outside of the box! :)
