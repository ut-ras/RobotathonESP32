# Wall Checkpoint/Challenge UNEDITED

Below is the premise for this checkpoint:
Checkpoint 4: I’m Dumb, Not Stupid (Wall Following)

Some things you should look out for:
IR sensor placement
There is a previous page in this guide that discusses sensor placement so be sure to take a look at this when working on the checkpoint
You can always experiment with different IR sensor placement since you will be given 2! 
Touch Sensor Use
It is up to your group whether or not you would like to utilize the touch sensor for this challenge as well. It could serve to help change direction if your robot were to run into a wall (hint hint)
Your code (dun dun dun)
This is of course a very  important aspects of this checkpoint!! I know this part is one of the hardest and most time consuming so try to get a head start and come to office hours if you need help!

Once you have completed this checkpoint you will have a better idea of what to expect from the Pacman Maze. 
Below is a sneak peak of the design for the maze…


Your robot will have to traverse this area and reach the end accordingly. This challenge will specifically test your ability to validate the IR sensors and either error correct or have good control loops to remain in range of good data. The maximum amount of points you can obtain by completing this challenge is 24. If your robot gets stuck or cannot complete the maze then you can still receive partial points for the amount of pellets you cross.




One thing that helps is making sure that your robot can execute  accurate 90 degree turns. Try to think of some ways that you could experiment with wheel direction and speed. Maybe one motor going slower than the other or rotating the opposite direction o_o
