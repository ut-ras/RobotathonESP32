# Chassis Construction

Now that you have some idea of your drive system layout, let’s look at how to build a base for your bot. While you can use a Poptart box to house everything (yes, it’s been done), we highly encourage you to use one of following methods using the tools found at TIW.

Note that you will have to be trained by TIW staff to use their equipment. Their Canvas page for training can be [accessed here!](https://inventionworks.engr.utexas.edu/training)

## Subtractive Manufacturing (SM)
SM, like laser cutting or mills/lathes, removes material from a product to achieve an end result. The laser cutters in the Makerspace can cut things like wood or acrylic sheets.

**Pros of laser cutting:** Fast process, best for larger items, can engrave

**Cons of laser cutting:** Must pay for material, must be trained at TIW

## Additive Manufacturing (AM)
AM, such as 3D printing, adds layers of materials to create an object. The CraftBots in the Makerspace use PLA or PETG (plastic) filaments. 

**Pros of 3D printing:** Free, best for small 3D parts, no certification required

**Cons of 3D printing:** Slow process (also prone to more error), main CraftBots are limited to 1 ft<sup>3</sup>

Tolerances for 3D printers:
- 0.0175” for a loose fit
- 0.01”  for a friction fit

You can create your chassis out of a single part or attach many parts together. If you decide to do many parts, adhesives like hot glue, wood glue, and (of course) duct tape work great.

## Extra Tips
- Don’t forget to add holes or section dividers for wheels, wires, sensors, etc.
- Make sure to design your chassis to accomodate your breadboard and wires!
- If you’re a visual person, create an assembly in Solidworks of your robot base before constructing! Find part files online or create rough estimate shapes and see how everything fits together.
- When fastening things like sensors or casters, temporarily secure with foam tape then use other adhesives once you’re 100% certain!
