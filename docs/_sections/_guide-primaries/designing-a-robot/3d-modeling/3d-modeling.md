# Choosing a software
There are many 3D modeling applications with a varying amount of features. A few programs that are availiable: SoildWorks, Fusion, Creo Parametic, FreeCad, Onshape, TinkerCad (primative-based) or even Blender (more for 3D artists). Generally, the more feature-rich a program is, the steeper the learning curve because it can be overwhelming and sometimes frustrating (looking at you, SoildWorks!). All but SoildWorks are free (personal/education license), for SoildWorks you have to be a Mechanical Engineering major or lie to the ME department to get SoildWorks license from UT.

Despite their different looks, they all have the same fundametals and more than meet the needs for most projects. Here are things to consider when choosing a program:

- **Familiarity:** These programs all have different mouse controls schemes, the default will feel intuitive for some users but not for others. Fortunately, OnShape, Fusion and FreeCad have customizable mouse controls to fit a wider variety of preferences.

- **Software compatibility:** SoildWorks and Creo, for example only runs on Windows. Fusion can run on both Windows and MacOS. FreeCad can be ran on Windows, MacOS and Linux. Onshape will be fine with any devices that has a browser (like phones and Chromebooks). _Note that we are not considering Vitural Machine options here because it is not practical to set up nor good for regular usage._

- **Hardware compatibility:** It is important to choose the right program for your device hardware to avoid any unpleasant experience. Programs that need to be installed, SoildWorks, Creo, Fusion and FreeCad have higher system requirements than Onshape, which is web-based. Additionally, programs can react differently to varying inputs such as trackpad or touchscreen input that some users might prefer. For example, SoildWorks can be used with a touchscreen and a trackpad, but Onshape refuses to take a input from those sources.

**This guide will focus on getting started with modeling in Onshape, as it's suitable for beginers thanks it's simple interface, customizable controls and strong compatitbility.**
