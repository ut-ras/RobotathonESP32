# 3D Modeling with Onshape

# TODO: finish this page

{: .highlight}
Onshape has excellent documentation on its [help website](https://cad.onshape.com/help/Content/sketch.htm?tocpath=Part%20Studios%7C_____0) (also can be found on the top right corner of your homepage), and should be referenced when you need more detailed help of a specific feature.

### Sign up and setting up OnShape
1. Create an Onshape account using any email with and choose a student (education) subscription, this will allow your designs to be private if desired. Go to [Onshape signup](https://www.onshape.com/en/sign-up) and follow the onscreen instructions.
2. You should be at the intial setup screen where you can choose your units, controls preferences as well as test your browser, it might tell you "reduced performace detected" if you are using intergrated graphics, don't be offended, you'll be fine. You can change all of these settings later in your account page (top right corner).

After that, you are ready to go! The Onshape quickstart will guide you through Onshape's features.

### Getting the most of the user interface
Despite having one of the simplest interface of any CAD programs, Onshape can still hide some very useful features from you. Be sure to explore on your own! Some features of interest may be:
- Tab manager
- Search
- Feature visibility
- File storage
- Keybinds/shortcuts
- 3D space navigation

### Invite your team!
Team work make dream work! Onshape behaves a lot like Google Docs/GitHub in the sense that the workspace can be shared and worked on by multiple epeople simultaneously.

### Making your first part
Sketching is extremely important in CAD (you wouldn't be able to do anything else without sketching first). Some things to look into:
- Planes
- Shapes
- Constraints
- References

### Making your second, third, fourth,... part
Being organized is the key to reducing hassle while designing, learn the effective tools to be organized! Important considerations for organzation are:
- Variable studio
- Naming
- Folders
- Appearance

### We Thief a bit (sometimes)
Sometimes you don't want to spend the time modeling something that already exists out on the internet. Aside from [GrabCad](https://grabcad.com/library), you can also get 3D models of parts you need straight in Onshape and quicky model with it.
TODO: write **or link** a tutorial on how to import models into an onshape project

### Put it all together!
Time to see your robot coming together virtually. This step is very important to make sure you don't spend your time making a prototype that you later finds having just that one little dimension that is wrong and rendering the entire thing usable!!! (sometimes recklessly drilling would fix the problem, but we apparently don't recommend that)
_Adding parts, attaching parts, types of mates, fixing_
### Making that annoying part
Some parts just have dimensions that are really difficult to keep track of, such as when it depends on something else that keeps changing.
_Part studio in context, editing part in context, derived parts_
### Lining up at Texas Invention Works
Now that you have confirmed that your part works and any small oversights has been ironed out, you have to transfer your design to a different program to make it (see: constructing chassis page) learn how to get your design "Offshape"
_STL export, STEP export, DXF export_
### Some neat things for later
Now you have got a pretty good basic understanding of CADing, and if you decide that you are going to stick with Onshape for your modeling needs, here a some cool things to explore:
- FeatureScript is a extremely useful tool, performing different modeling task the stock Onshape can't do. And the cool thing is, you can code your own FeatureScript to improve your modeling experience and help other users.
- App store is a marketplace for addons, from a full-blown 3D printing slicer to a catalog of standard part selection, you can really make Onshape work better for your usage.
- You can make complex lively machines in assembly using the animation feature to evaluate how parts interact.
- A whole libary of lessons with varying difficulties can be found on [Onshape learning](https://learn.onshape.com/)
