lorem ipsum here is some text
When designing and building your robot you need to think about the placement of your sensors!
Distance (IR) Sensor:
The distance sensor will be used during the wall following portion of the competition. The location of the distance sensor can affect your chassis design and code so it is important to decide on a good location!! Also remember that you have more than one IR sensor available to you so use this to your advantage. Below are some different ideas:
aaaaa
Line Sensor and Color Sensor:
These two sensors will have similar placement! The line sensor and color sensor will be used to to detect what is right underneath the robot so these two will be placed on the bottom of your robot. Make sure your sensors are very close to the ground in order for them to function properly!! Below are some diagrams and pictures to help you visualize this:

Since your sensors need to be very close to the ground you should consider how you will be building the chassis of your robot and how you will attach these sensors. Your wheels will add some height to your chassis so you might have to add some form of support to the bottom in order to hold your sensors close to the ground.
