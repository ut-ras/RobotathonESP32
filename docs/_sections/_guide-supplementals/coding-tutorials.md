# Coding Tutorials

## 1. Variables and Data Types

Variables are named storage locations in memory for holding data. Each variable has a specific **data type**, such as `int` for integers or `double` for floating-point numbers, which dictates the kind of information it can store and the operations that can be performed on it.

* **Tutorial:** **[geeksforgeeks: C++ Basics](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/cpp-programming-basics/)**

## 2. Operators

Operators are symbols that specify a computation when applied to operands. C++ includes **arithmetic** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), **relational** (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`), and **logical** (`&&`, `||`, `!`) operators, which are fundamental for performing calculations and forming logical expressions.

* **Tutorial:** **[GeeksforGeeks - C++ Operators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operators-in-cpp/)**

## 3. Control Flow

Control flow statements direct the order in which program instructions are executed. **Conditional statements** like `if`, `else if`, and `else` allow the program to execute different blocks of code based on the evaluation of a specific logical condition.

* **Tutorial:** **[geeksforgeeks - if/else Statements](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/c-c-if-else-statement-with-examples/)**

## 4. Loops

Loops facilitate the repeated execution of a block of code. **Iterative constructs** such as `for` and `while` loops are used to perform a task multiple times, either for a predetermined number of iterations or until a specific condition is met.

* **Tutorial:** **[w3schools - While Statements](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_while_loop.asp)**
* **Tutorial:** **[GeeksforGeeks - C++ `for` Loop](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/cpp-for-loop/)**

## 5. Functions

A function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task. Functions promote **modularity** and **code reuse**, allowing for more organized, maintainable, and scalable software by encapsulating logic that can be called from multiple points in a program.
