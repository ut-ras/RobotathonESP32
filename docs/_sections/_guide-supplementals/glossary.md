**Abstracted:** When details have been simplified, hidden, or removed from your perspective or the task at hand. The purpose of abstraction is to make your tasks easier or more manageable in the Robotathon learning environment.

**Algorithm:** In a software context, and algorithm is a systematic or step-by-step approach that guides the development of software or the implementation of certain functionalities.

**Analog:**A type of signal usually represented by continuously varying PHYSICAL quantities such as voltage, current, or sound waves.

**Binary:**A form of representation of data in the form of bits. Each bit can either hold the value 0 or 1.
**Breadboard:** A device used to create temporary electrical connections between components like resistors, LEDs, and wires without the need for soldering.

**Bodge:** A temporary fix or workaround.

**Bug Fixing:**The process of identifying and resolving issues or bugs in software or systems. When software is developed, it can contain errors or defects that cause unintended behavior or malfunctions. Bug fixing is the act of locating these issues and implementing solutions to rectify them.

**Caster Ball:** A specialized wheel assembly designed for easy movement and rotation.

**Chassis:**A chassis is a framework or structure that provides support and holds together various components of a larger system or device. It serves as a foundation or base on which other parts are mounted or attached.

**CLI:** Stands for "Command Line Interface". A user can interact with the computer through typing commands into a terminal (which is a CLI)

**Compile:**the process of converting source code written in a high-level programming language into a lower-level language or machine code that can be understood and executed by a computer.

**Continuity Mode:**"Continuity mode" is a feature available on many multimeters, which is used to test for electrical continuity in a circuit. Continuity refers to the presence of a complete path for electric current to flow through a circuit without any breaks or interruptions.

**Development Environment:** A development environment, also known as an integrated development environment (IDE), is a software application or platform that provides tools, features, and an interface to assist developers in writing, testing, and debugging software applications. It is a comprehensive environment designed to streamline the development process and enhance productivity.

**Digital:** A digital signal is a type of signal that represents discrete values or states. It consists of a series of voltage or current levels that are encoded to represent binary digits (bits), typically using two distinct voltage levels or states. The two voltage levels are often referred to as "high" and "low," "1" and "0," or "on" and "off."

**Flash:** Loading your programmed code onto the microcontroller.

**Function:** A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task or a set of instructions. It is a fundamental concept in programming and is used to organize code into modular and reusable units.

**GPIO:** Stands for General Purpose Input/Output.It is a common feature found on microcontrollers, single-board computers, and other embedded systems. GPIO pins provide a way to interface with external devices or circuits by providing input or receiving output signals.

**Interfacing:** In the context of programming and electronics, "interfacing" refers to the process of connecting and communicating between different components or systems. It involves establishing a connection or interface that allows for the exchange of data, signals, or commands between the entities involved.

**IR Sensor:** An IR (Infrared) sensor is a device that detects and responds to infrared radiation in its surrounding environment. It is commonly used for proximity sensing, object detection, and remote control applications. Infrared radiation is electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths longer than those of visible light, but shorter than radio waves.

**I2C:** I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a serial communication protocol commonly used to enable communication between integrated circuits (ICs) or electronic components on a circuit board. It was developed by Philips Semiconductors (now NXP Semiconductors) and has become a widely adopted standard for communication between devices.

**LED:** An LED (Light Emitting Diode) is a semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current passes through it. LEDs are widely used for various applications, including indicators, displays, lighting, and visual communication.

**Line Sensor:** A line sensor, also known as a line follower sensor, is a device used to detect and follow lines or tracks on a surface. It is commonly used in robotics, particularly in line-following robots or automated systems where precise tracking along a specific path is required.

**Motor:** A motor is a device that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy, allowing for the generation of motion or the application of force. Motors are widely used in various applications, from industrial machinery to consumer electronics, robotics, automotive systems, and more.

**Multimeter:** A versatile electronic instrument used to measure various electrical quantities.

**RGB Color Sensor:** An RGB color sensor is a device used to detect and measure the intensity of red, green, and blue light in order to determine the color of an object or surface. It can analyze the spectral components of light and provide data about the color composition.

**RGB Color Space:** RGB color space is a color model used to represent colors by specifying their intensity values for the primary colors: red (R), green (G), and blue (B). It is widely used in digital imaging, computer graphics, and display technologies.

**Servo Motor:** A servo motor is a type of motor that is specifically designed for precise control of angular position, velocity, and acceleration.

**Short:** A short circuit occurs when a low-resistance path is unintentionally created between two points in an electri that are supposed to have different potentials (voltages).

**SOLIDWORKS:** A computer-aided design (CAD) software package that is widely used for 3D modeling, simulation, and design documentation. It is developed by Dassault Syst√®mes and is renowned for its powerful capabilities and user-friendly interface.
